Over two to four years, you&rsquo;ll work with cutting-edge technology and build your experience in anything from submarine and commercial marine projects, to next-generation construction projects in civil nuclear.</p>\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n<h2>Where you can join us</h2>\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n<p>Places on our Process Engineering graduate programme for Autumn 2018 are available within our Marine (Plymouth) sector. But no matter which team you join, you could be based anywhere in the UK. That&rsquo;s why we ask all our graduates to be flexible and willing to move during their programme.</p>\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n<h2>What you&#39;ll be doing</h2>\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n<p>There&rsquo;s so much you could potentially do at Babcock. You may find yourself working on submarine projects or commercial marine programmes. Equally, you might help decommission old nuclear power plants or create new ones. What&rsquo;s certain is that you&rsquo;ll immerse yourself in cutting-edge technologies and gain the experiences needed to develop a specialism in this technical discipline.</p>\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n<h2>What you&#39;ll get out of it</h2>\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n<p>You&rsquo;ll get our full support on your road to becoming an Incorporated or Chartered Engineer &ndash; and a competitive starting salary of &pound;28k-&pound;30k.* And while you&rsquo;re working towards it, you can help us get school kids excited about becoming engineers too, through our work with local schools.</p>\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n<h2>What you&#39;ll need</h2>\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need a 2:2 MEng degree in Chemical Engineering (or similar). And because the programme is accredited by the IChemE, IMechE, IET and RINA, your degree should be accredited by the relevant institution. Our Rosyth business unit requires a 2:1 BEng (Hons) degree.
